    <h1>Experimental setup</h1>
    <p>
        The interferometer is designed for a pi shift at 120 keV and the
        first Talbot order. G1 and G2 are the same throughout the tests for
        all the G0s and were also made by Microworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tube is a Comet MXR/160-HP11 with a voltage of 160 kVp and a
        current of 10 mA.
    </p>
    <p>
        The detector is a Mythen module also illuminated in an edge-on
        fashion, with a minimum energy threshold of 20 keV.
